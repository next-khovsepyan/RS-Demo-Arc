Reelshot Application
Welcome to the Reelshot application repository. This repository contains a selection of small code examples that illustrate the core architectural concepts of our application. It's designed to provide insights into our application's structure and to share the main ideas behind our architectural choices.

Key Features
Descriptive Comments and Documentation
In our project, we heavily emphasize the use of descriptive comments and detailed documentation. This approach ensures that during the development stage, any developer, regardless of their familiarity with the project, can quickly understand each part of the application and its purpose.

Extensive Logging
We have implemented extensive logging throughout the application. During the development stage, these logs are invaluable for ensuring that we have full control and oversight over all parts of the application's functions. This not only aids in debugging but also provides a clear trail of how the application processes data and handles operations.
